You will find a directory for each task:
- Testbench_Filter
- Task2

Inside each of each task directory you can find the following subdirectories:
- src:
	where vhdl source files can be stored separately from other files like the modelsim project files
	
- simulation:
	where simulation related files can be stored, like the modelsim files
	
- synthesis:
	where synthesis related files can be stored (like ise files) for tasks where the project has to be synthesized (can change each year)
